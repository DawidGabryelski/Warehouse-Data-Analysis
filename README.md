# Project: Control Logistic Analysis of Warehouse

## Overview

Warehouse efficieny is one of the key elements of well-working supply chain. That project focus on analyzing the warehouse procedures and searching for bottlenecks or places that can be improved. 
Utilizing the ABC/XYZ segmentation we can geoup items in our warehouse and find which elemnts are most important to us and need more interest and which are consuming our resources.

## Business Problem: Lack of actionable data 

The logistic dataset we used to this project have some gaps. We have many of data like time of packing or daily demand but we don't have data like weight of the items, their sizes or where are they
located. Without basic data like this we can't properly manage place like the warehouse. Best we can do in that situation is grouping the data to discover that we corectly divorce our time and money
in corect places.
